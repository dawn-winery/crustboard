# crustboard

Starboard replacement, wip

TODO:
- `/showboard <name>`
- `/showboards`
- `/editboard <name> <dest-channel>? <reactions>? <min_reactions>?`
- `/deleteboard <name>`

for above commands you could probably instead of using `<name>` as key, give user a list of options to choose from.

COMPLETED:
- `/addboard <name> <dest-channel> <reactions> <min_reactions>?`
- sending messages to dest-channel
- editing messages to update reaction count
